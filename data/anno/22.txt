22-Month-Old
Your toddler is 22 months old!
Your toddler is the center of the universe—her own. Kids this age are rarely great at taking turns and sharing, and they can seem downright rude[[Rude]]. Keep your cool and model good behavior, so she sees what she's supposed to be doing. She’ll catch on, oh, in a year or so.

22-Month-Old Development
As your growing 22-month-old learns new skills, she might get frustrated when she has trouble doing—or isn’t allowed to do—the thing she wants. But resist the urge to always jump in and help. A little challenge from time to time helps your child gain more independence.

22-Month-Old Weight & Height
Average weight for a 22-month-old is 25.4 pounds for girls and 25.9 pounds for boys. Average height for a 22-month-old is 33.4 inches for girls and 33.9 inches for boys[[hasGirlWieght]][[hasBoyWieght]][[hasGirlHeight]][[hasBoyHeight]].

22-Month-Old Milestones
Here are some milestones your 22-month-old may have hit or may be working on as he nears his second birthday:
• Motor skills. Your 22-month-old might be kicking a ball[[KickingBall]], walking backwards[[WalkingBackwards]], and perhaps even balancing on one foot [[StandingOneFoot]]while holding onto a sturdy chair or wall. Soon, she might be able to pedal a tricycle[[RidingTricycle]].
• Speech. She's probably saying 50 words or as many as 100[[Speaking50To100Words]].
• Teething. Your toddler's lower second molars and/or upper second molars might be erupting[[TeethingUpperSecondMolar]][[TeethingLowerSecondMolar]], causing some teething discomfort.
• Potty Training. Some 22-month-olds show signs of potty training readiness[[SomePottyTrainingReady]]. You can start encouraging him to sit on the potty. But beware of putting pressure on your kid to potty train—it's still early. He’s more likely to be ready to start once he reaches 27 to 32 months.

22-Month-Old Behavior
As your child gets older, here’s advice on how to deal with new behaviors:
• Tantrums. Even though your kid's language is developing by leaps and bounds, she still can't communicate everything she wants to say, and that can lead to some meltdowns.
• Autism. At the upcoming two-year checkup, your child's pediatrician will likely ask you a series of questions about your child's behavior to look for signs of autism. But if you have any concerns about your child's behavior, you shouldn't feel shy about bringing them up to the doctor before that.
• Seeking approval[[SeekingApproval]]. Soon your child will show signs he's aware of your approval…or disapproval. This is an important early step in learning positive behaviors.
• Exploration[[SexualCuriosity]]. Try not to be alarmed if your toddler starts touching her private parts. This is normal for both boys and girls at this stage and isn’t cause for concern.

22-Month-Old Health
Common health questions parents of 22-month-old toddlers have include:
• My 22-month-old has diarrea. What should I do?
• My 22-month-old is constipated. What should I do?
• My 22-month-old is throwing up. What should I do?
• My 22-month-old has a fever. What should I do?

22-Month-Old Sleep
Whether your child loves or hates bedtime, you probably have questions about what's typical when it comes to sleep for a 22-month-old, and what to do when there are hiccups in the usual sleep routine.

How Much Sleep Does My 22-Month-Old Need?
Most 22-month-olds need around 11 to 12 hours of nighttime sleep, plus a nap of about 1.5 to 3 hours, for a total of about 13 to 14 hours of sleep per day.
Every kid is different, but your child's schedule may look something like this:

22-Month-Old Sleep Regression
Is your 22-month-old waking up in the middle of the night? Sleep regression can happen because of teething, separation anxiety or a change in sleep routine. To get back to the usual sleep routine, it's important to know the root of the problem, so you can help your child get through it. Stick with the usual bedtime routine and set limits (such as no sleeping in mommy and daddy's room) that will help your child get back on track.

Night Terrors in 22-Month-Olds
A 22-month-old waking up screaming at night might be having a night terror. A night terror is defined as a crying or screaming episode where the child never really wakes, so is unresponsive. Don't try to wake your child during a night terror; just do your best to calm him back to restful sleep. And be sure his sleeping space is safe to avoid injury if he flails or walks around.
The good news is these seemingly wild sleep disruptions are only upsetting for you. Kids don't even remember them! And they tend to grow out of having them by around age 9.
There's no known cause of night terrors, but stress, changes in routine and overtiredness can all play a role. So try to stick to a calming bedtime routine, and put your child to bed early enough so he can get a full night's rest.

22-Month-Old Food
The key to feeding a 22-month-old is variety. Even if you know she's only going to eat her rice[[Rice]], it's still important to serve the chicken [[Chicken]]and veggies with it.

How Much Should My 22-Month-Old Eat and Drink?
One- to 2-year-olds should be eating much like you do: three meals per day, plus two snacks. Portion size isn't big at this age: Expect your kid to eat a serving of pasta the size of a Ping-Pong ball, protein as big as four marbles, and chopped veggies or fruit around the size of four dominoes—these are all considered normal portions for a toddler this age.
About three 8-ounce cups of whole milk per day is recommended for a 22-month-old, if she doesn't get calcium from other foods. Aim for about 700 mg of calcium total per day.
If you're weaning your 22-month-old from breastfeeding, remember to go slow. Drop one daily nursing session for at least three to seven days before dropping the next. If you go too fast, you could risk plugged ducts and infection. Plus, it's a transition that could have an emotional effect on your child, so she may need a little extra comfort while weaning.

What to Feed My 22-Month-Old
Continue to offer your child a variety of foods at each meal and during snack time. Most toddlers should eat about ¾ to 1 cup of fruits and veggies, ¼ cup grains and three tablespoons of protein per day.

22-Month-Old Won’t Eat
Got a picky eater? Most toddlers do get proper nutrition when their parents serve a variety of foods—even if it doesn’t always seem that way. But, unlike adults who often eat out of habit or boredom, toddlers tend to eat only when they’re hungry. And remember: New foods are scary to your toddler. So manage your expectations; it may take inspecting new foods several times before he’ll actually taste them—don’t force it. But continue trying, so he gets used to sampling different flavors[[WaitingChildGetUsedTo]].

Activities for a 22-Month-Old
Playtime helps your 22-month-old make sense of the world and develop her skills.

Things to Do With a 22-Month-Old
Fun activities, games and toys for a 22-month-old include:
• Pretend play[[PlayingPretend]]. Dress-up clothes, vehicles, toy cash registers and play food are all popular toys at this age.
• Riding toys[[RidingToy]]. Cars, wagons and pushcarts will keep your on-the-go tot busy.
• Musical instruments[[PlayingMusicalInstrument]]. Make some noise with kid-friendly xylophones, piano and drums.
• Books[[ReadingBook]]. These are always a favorite, and you should continue to read to your toddler every day.

22-Month-Old Baby Checklist/Tips
• Let your toddler know that interrupting isn't okay by not responding right away when he does it[[NotRespondingRightAway]]. Wrap up the conversation you’re having quickly and then give him your attention when you're done.
• Teach your toddler to sneeze or cough into the crook of her elbow[[CoughIntoCrook]]—not in her hands—to avoid the spread of germs.
• Explore new foods with your toddler[[EploreNewFood]]. If he doesn’t like something, keep it offering it along with foods he does like.
