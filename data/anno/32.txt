32-Month-Old
Your toddler is 32 months old!
This may be the moment you’ve been waiting for, or maybe it’s the one you’re dreading: Potty training. Most kids are ready to begin toilet training sometime between the ages of 2 and 3. If your child can stay dry for a couple of hours, lets you know when their diaper is wet or soiled, or shows an interest in using the potty, they're probably ready. Keep the motivation positive and pressure-free. Kids this age learn best by example, so take him into the bathroom with you when you go (if you feel comfortable with that). Even better? Point out older friends or siblings who use the potty, and talk it up!

32-Month-Old Development
In addition to potty training, there are a bunch of other milestones and skills your growing child is working on this month.

32-Month-Old Weight & Height
Average weight for a 32-month old is around 29.4 pounds for girls and 30.5 pounds for boys. Average height is around 36.1 inches for girls and 36.5 inches for boys, according to the US Centers for Disease Control.

32-Month-Old Milestones
What should my 32-month-old be doing?
Here are some milestones your 32-month-old may have hit or may be working on:
• Speech. Thirty-two-month-old speech development is happening fast. Your child may be using pronouns correctly and understands how to follow directions with multiple steps.
• Motor skills. Kids this age are getting good at walking up and down stairs. Your child may be able to draw a shape or two[[DrawingSimpleShape]], put together a simple puzzle, jump, and pedal a trike.
• Teething. You may be experiencing your kid's last bout of teething, with the 2-year molars making their appearance around this age.
• Potty training. If you haven't started potty training your 32-month-old, now might be the time. In a study, researchers found that the number one factor that affected potty training success was starting between 27 and 32 months (aka now). Obviously, every kid is different, but kids older than yours tend to be more resistant to the process.

32-Month-Old Behavior
• Bad manners[[BadManner]]. Sharing and being polite might still be tough for a kid this age, but keep using “please” and “thank you” in conversation, and talking up the concept of sharing. Be patient—they'll get it in time.
• Friendship[[Friendship]]. A 32-month-old tends to be really interested in other kids, and may have started making friends.
• Shyness[[Shyness]]. Feeling intimidated or sensitive in social situations is normal in a 2-year-old. For some kids, it's simply part of their personality. Even if you're a social butterfly, show your shy child empathy, and help him get accustomed to unfamiliar environments. And you may want to avoid labeling your kid as "shy." It's something they may simply outgrow, and you don't want to make them start to believe it.

32-Month-Old Health
Health is always a top concern for parents, and this age is no different. Some common health questions parents of 32-month-olds have are:
• My 32-month-old has diarrhea. What should I do? 
• My 32-month-old is constipated. What should I do? 
• My 32-month-old is throwing up. What should I do? 
• My 32-month old has a cough. What should I do? 
• My 32-month-old has a fever. What should I do?

32-Month-Old Sleep
To nap or not to nap? Most 32-month-olds still need an afternoon nap to help them get through the day. Just make sure it's early enough and short enough that it doesn't interfere with their ability to get sleepy at bedtime.

How Much Sleep Does a 32-Month-Old Need?
Most 2-year-olds need around 11 to 12 hours of nighttime sleep, plus a nap of about 1.5 to 3 hours, for a total of about 13 to 14 hours of sleep per day.
Every kid is different, but your child's schedule may look something like this:

32-Month-Old Sleep Problems
Some 32-month-olds resist nap time, but if your kid still gets grumpy if they don't get daytime rest, he still needs it. Enforce nap time at the same time every afternoon. If your kid refuses to sleep, you might want to tell them they don't have to, but they do need to stay in their room for a short period of quiet time. Some parents find their kid falls asleep anyhow. Others are just happy to give their tot a short break during the day.

32-Month-Old Food
Calcium, iron and fiber are a few nutrients toddlers tend not to get enough of. Experiment with different foods that deliver them—such as broccoli, spinach[[Spinach]], dark meat turkey[[Turkey]], raisins[[Raisin]] and pinto beans—to see which your child enjoys.

How Much Should My 32-Month-Old Be Eating?
Two-year-olds should continue to eat three meals per day, plus two snacks. Offer a variety of foods in all food groups—vegetables, fruits, grains, protein and dairy—daily. Portion size isn't big at this age: Expect your kid to eat only ¼ to ½ as much as an adult.
Your 2-year-old should be drinking 1 percent or skim milk (not whole milk). Try to offer low-fat dairy products, such as yogurt and cheese too. Doctors recommend kids ages 1 to 3 get 700 mg of calcium per day. Fat should account for less than 30 percent of your toddler's daily calories.

32-Month-Old Eating Problems
Can a 2-year-old have an eating disorder? Yes, it's possible! While picky eating is typical for this age, there are a few behaviors that fall into the category of a feeding disorder. For a variety of reasons—food aversions or refusing to eat, for example—these kids may not eat enough to gain weight at a healthy rate or may even lose weight.
Feeding disorders are common among kids who have developmental delays, but can happen with any child. If you suspect your child has a feeding disorder, get an evaluation from your pediatrician. She may refer your child to a dietician, a psychiatrist or psychologist, a speech language pathologist, an occupational therapist or all of the above.

Activities for a 32-Month-Old
For a 32-month-old, playtime equals learning time, so make sure your child has plenty of opportunities to use their imagination and motor skills (away from the tablet or TV screen).

What to do with a 32-month-old?
Fun activities, games and toys for a 32-month-old are:
• Rhyming[[Rhyming]]. Choose books that rhyme, or sing songs and say nursery rhymes and poems together. This helps your child increase their vocabulary and learn rhythm. Not to mention, they're a lot of fun!
• Pretend play. Thirty-two-month-olds tend to love to dress up in costumes, or mimic Mom and Dad by talking into a play phone, wearing your shoes, or sweeping the floor.
• Free play. Structured activities, like a trip to the playground or the aquarium, are certainly fun, but don't feel like your 32-month-old needs to be scheduled every second. Set aside time where your child can bang on pots and pans with wooden spoons, "camp" in a cardboard box, or race their toy cars across the living room floor—whatever it is they want to do.

32-Month-Old Baby Checklist/Tips
• Believe us, you do not want to flush standard baby wipes (unless you really like plunging your toilet). Instead, get your potty-training kid's bum clean with a wipe that clearly says “flushable” on the label.
• A hectic schedule isn't good for your 32-month-old, and it isn't good for you either. Make "me time" to decompress and have still have quality time with your family by saying "no" to unnecessary pastimes or activities. And consider hiring a sitter here and there to avoid burnout.
