30-Month-Old
Your toddler is 30 months—a.k.a. 2 ½ years—old!
Many pediatricians like to see kids around 30 months for a well-child visit[[ThirtyMonthMedicalCheck]]. That’s because a lot of development occurs between ages 2 and 3, and it's important to check things out at the midpoint. The doctor will probably ask how many words your child says. She’ll ask about motor skills too and may even ask your child to demonstrate some of them, such as walking and jumping. This could be a fun visit!

30-Month-Old Baby Development
The 30-month checkup is the place where growth and development are checked to be sure a child is making progress as expected.

30-Month-Old Weight & Height
Average weight for a 30-month-old is around 28.8 pounds for girls and 29.9 pounds for boys. Average height is around 35.6 inches for girls and 36.0 inches for boys, according to the US Centers for Disease Control.

30-Month-Old Milestones
What should my 30-month-old be doing?
Here are some milestones your 30-month-old may have hit or may be working on:
• Speech. At 30 months old, speech development is happening fast. It's normal for a 30-month-old vocabulary to be around 100 to 250 words[[SpeakingMore100To250Words]]. Your child may also be using two- or three- word phrases. A 30-month-old not talking may need to have a hearing evaluation and/or may need some help from an early intervention program. Discuss any concerns you may have about your child's speech development with your pediatrician.
• Motor skills. Thirty-month-olds can usually walk up and down stairs, kick and throw a ball, jump [[Jumping]]and build[[BuildingBlock]] towers of blocks.
• Teething. In a 30-month-old, teething may be happening. Also known as the 2-year molars, second molars tend to erupt between 20 and 33 months. And since they're big, it can be a painful process. The good news is they're the last teeth to come in until around age 6, when kids can better deal with the discomfort, so soon, you'll be done with teething woes.
• Potty Training. Some 30-month-olds are fully potty trained[[SomePottyTrainingFinished]] and some aren’t ready to start yet. It all depends on your child's interest level and abilities. To potty train a 30-month-old boy or girl, your child must be able to recognize when they have to go to the bathroom and must be able to pull their pants up and down. A weekend at home without training pants could help along the process; if it doesn't, that may mean your child just needs more time. Take a break before trying again later.

30-Month-Old Behavior
• Tantrums. At 30 months old, tantrums are still common. However, the peak time frame for tantrums tends to be between 17 and 24 months, [[DecliningTantrum]]so you might notice soon that their frequency is starting to decline. If your child has frequent tantrums (several per day), discuss it with the pediatrician because some kids need extra help learning to calm themselves down.
• DIY. Your child can probably undress herself now; some 30-month-olds pull on their own pants and socks too[[DressingIndependently]].
• Fickleness. Your kiddo is torn between wanting to be a big kid and wanting to be a baby. So some days, he might do things on his own and others, he insists you do it all. Some parents find that their 30-month-olds are well behaved at school or daycare but wild at home. He may be anxious or shy around strangers too.
• Regression. It's normal for a 2-year-old to regress in some ways, such as starting to tantrum more or having more potty accidents. Maybe your child asks for an old lovey or pacifier. This is often just a normal part of growing up, but tell the doctor about any setbacks that concern you.

30-Month-Old Health
Bring up any health questions or concerns to the doctor at the 30-month checkup. Some common health questions parents of 30-month-olds have are:
• My 30-month-old has diarrhea. What should I do? 
• My 30-month-old is constipated. What should I do? 
• My 30-month-old is throwing up. What should I do? 
• My 30-month old has a cough. What should I do? 
• My 30-month-old has a fever. What should I do?

30-Month-Old Sleep
Sleep is super important for any kid – not just 30-month-olds. Kids needs sleep for growth and brain development and to keep their mood in check.

How Much Sleep Does a 30-Month-Old Need?
Most 2-year-olds need around 11 to 12 hours of nighttime sleep, plus a nap of about 1.5 to 3 hours, for a total of about 13 to 14 hours of sleep per day.
Every kid is different, but your child's schedule may look something like this:

30-Month-Old Sleep Problems
For a 30-month-old, sleep regression can happen. If your child was previously sleeping just fine at night but is suddenly waking, it can disrupt the whole family's routine. Some kids become fearful of the dark and some just miss Mom and Dad. If there isn't a health concern that's waking your kid, it's good to be firm about bedtime boundaries. Calm your child down, put them back to bed and try to stick to the routine as much as you can.
Some kids around this age refuse to take a nap[[RefusingNap]]. And honestly, there's not much you can do about it. As the saying (kind of) goes: You can lead a kid to a bed but you can't make them sleep. Continue to block out time each afternoon for a nap or a rest. You can tell your child it's okay to look at books quietly in his room. For some children, this is enough to bring on a nap. But others are never going back to daytime sleeping. If you find your kid really isn't napping anymore, it's okay to give up on it, and start putting her to bed earlier at night.

30-Month-Old Food
While your kid might wish they could eat the same three foods all the time, continue to offer new flavors, textures and styles of cooking. While they may not always love it, just getting him used to having new things on his plate may help him warm up the idea of trying out different dishes.

How Much Should My 30-Month-Old Be Eating?
Two-year-olds should continue to eat three meals per day, plus two snacks. Offer a variety of foods in all food groups—vegetables, fruits, grains, protein and dairy—daily. Portion size isn't big at this age: Expect your kid to eat only ¼ to ½ as much as an adult.
Your 2-year-old should be drinking 1% or skim milk (not whole milk). Try to offer low-fat dairy products, such as yogurt and cheese too. Doctors recommend kids ages one to three get 700 mg of calcium per day. Fat should account for less than 30 percent of your toddler's daily calories.

30-Month-Old Eating Problems
Picky eating may still be a big food issue at 30 months. The checkup is the perfect time to bring up any worries you may have about your child's eating habits. The doctor will weigh and measure your child to be sure they're growing at a healthy rate and may check for an iron deficiency. Her findings may give you peace of mind that everything's A-okay, or they may prompt her to prescribe a vitamin supplement. She may also give you advice on how to get your child to eat more nutritious foods.

Activities for 30-Month-Old
In a 30-month-old's eyes, playtime is just fun—but it's also helping your child develop.
What to do with a 30-month-old?
Fun activities, games and toys for a 30-month-old are:
• Puzzles. Step back and let your child have a feeling of accomplishment by putting the pieces together on their own. Of course, you can step in and help if they're getting frustrated.
• Coloring. Your child's dexterity is improving. They may even be able to draw some simple shapes.
• Clay[[PlayingClay]] or Play-Doh. Working with hands can help keep a wiggly toddler busy on a rainy day.

30-Month-Old Baby Checklist/Tips
• Take your toddler to their 2 ½-year (30-month) checkup.
• There aren't typically shots at this visit, but your child may get any vaccinations they didn't get at previous appointments. The doctor may also do a blood test for iron-deficiency anemia and/or lead poisoning.
• Stop by the doctor’s office sometime when there aren’t vaccinations and blood tests. Or, after the shots, give your child time to calm down and relax. They'll leave with positive thoughts about the place, making next time less tense.
• Schedule your child's 3-year checkup.
