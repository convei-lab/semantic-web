34-Month-Old
Your toddler is 34 months old!
Are you planning to send your child to school? The best 3-year-old preschools focus on play and socialization; kids learn by exploring and interacting. They also gradually learn how to wait their turn, stand in line and follow rules—essential skills that will help throughout her school career. But it’s not a necessity to enroll your kid yet if you don’t feel she's ready. You know best whether or not she is.

34-Month-Old Development
You'll probably notice your 34-month-old is getting taller and looks less chubby as he nears his third birthday.
34-Month-Old Weight & Height
Average weight for a 34-month-old is around 30.1 pounds for girls and 31.1 pounds for boys. Average height is around 36.6 inches for girls and 37.0 inches for boys, according to the US Centers for Disease Control.
34-Month-Old Milestones
What should my 34-month-old be doing?
Here are some milestones your 34-month-old may have hit or may be working on:
• 
Speech.
 By now, strangers should be able to understand most of the words your child says, which probably totals somewhere between 200 and 450. Your child should be able to follow three- or four-step directions.
• 
Motor skills.
 Around age 3, most kids can walk up and down stairs, jump, do simple puzzles, and pedal a tricycle.
• 
Self-care.
 Your child is working on learning to undress and feed herself.
• 
Potty training.
 Some 34-month-olds are fully potty trained and some won't be ready until they're 3 or 4. If yours is still wearing training pants, there's no need to rush it. Every kid learns at his own pace. But talking up the potty in a positive way and reading children's books about potty training certainly could help.
34-Month-Old Behavior
• 
Bossiness.
 Got a little tyrant at home? Your 34-month-old thinks the world revolves around her—you can't change that just yet. But you can teach her to speak kindly, say please, and to not order everyone around.
• 
Short attention span.
 Don't worry too much about ADHD at this age. Two-year-olds are normally easily distractible and want to follow their own agenda.
• 
Sense of humor.
 Your little one is learning what's funny and what's not, making just about every task a little more entertaining for everyone. Let yourself get a little silly at times too.
34-Month-Old Health

Thirty-four-month-olds sure need a lot of sleep, but that doesn't mean they actually want to go to bed.
How Much Sleep Does a 34-Month-Old Need?
Most 2-year-olds need around 11 to 12 hours of nighttime sleep, plus a nap of about 1.5 to 3 hours, for a total of about 13 to 14 hours of sleep per day.
Every kid is different, but your child's schedule may look something like this:

34-Month-Old Food
Feeding your child a well-rounded diet full of many nutrients will help fuel your 34-month-old's growth and brain and physical development.
How Much Should My 34-Month-Old Be Eating?
Two-year-olds should continue to eat three meals per day, plus two snacks. Offer him a variety of foods in all food groups—vegetables, fruits, grains, protein and dairy—daily. Portion size isn't big at this age: Expect your kid to eat only ¼ to ½ as much as an adult.
Your 2-year-old should be drinking 1 percent or skim milk (not whole milk). Try to offer low-fat dairy products, such as yogurt and cheese too. Doctors recommend kids ages 1 to 3 get 700 mg of calcium per day. Fat should account for less than 30 percent of your toddler's daily calories.

34-Month-Old Eating Problems
It's common for kids this age to overdo it with milk and juice. Because of the calories in these drinks, having too many of them could put a child at risk for obesity. Experts recommend 16 ounces of milk per day and 4 ounces or less of juice per day. And skip the soda.
Activities for a 34-Month-Old
It's good for a 34-month-old to have a mix of solo play, play with a parent, and play with someone her own age.
What to do with a 34-month-old?
Fun activities, games and toys for a 34-month-old are:
• 
Drawing.
 Show your 34-month-old how to draw a circle and see if he can do it. Once he's mastered that skill, you can draw faces together and move on to other shapes too.
• 
Puzzles.
 It's a fun challenge for a 34-month-old to put together simple puzzles.
• 
Play dates.
 As your child becomes more interested in making friends and playing with kids her own age, you'll want to give her opportunities to do that. Kids this age still need help and practice in sharing and taking turns.
34-Month-Old Baby Checklist/Tips
• Change in routine? Give plenty of advance warning. And be prepared to repeat, “You’re right. Usually we do it that way, but today we’re going to do it this way,” at least two or three 
dozen
 times.
• Your child's screen time should still be limited. Your child learns better through hands-on play, and you simply don't want your kid to get into the bad habit of too much TV or tablet. Encourage old-school play as much as possible, with small spurts of screen time.
