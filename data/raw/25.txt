25-Month-Old
Your toddler is 25 months old!
Has your 25-month-old started to exert her independence? We’re talking about stomping, screaming, defying and all those other frustrating (and totally normal for this age) behaviors. Two-year-olds are possibly the most stubborn, self-centered creatures on earth. They want what they want, when they want it—usually, right now! The good news is your child’s stubborn streak means she’s going through a ton of cognitive growth. She now understands that she’s a separate person who can make things happen in the world. So of course, she's making them happen. Rest assured that eventually, things will get less, um, dramatic.

25-Month-Old Development
In addition to his (sometimes frustrating) personality, your 25-month-old's body and brain continue to grow and develop in a variety of ways.
25-Month-Old Weight & Height
Average weight for a 25-month- old is around 27.1 pounds for girls and 28.4 pounds for boys. Average height is around 34.0 inches for girls and 34.5 inches for boys, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
25-Month-Old Milestones
What should my 25-month-old be doing? Here are some milestones your 25-month-old may have hit or may be working on:
• 
Speech.
 Your 25-month-old probably uses simple phrases and may be saying two- to four-word sentences. Most 2-year-olds are able to say 50 to 100 words. If your 25-month-old isn’t talking, let your pediatrician know. Some kids simply need more time; others may have a hearing problem or may benefit from an early intervention program.
• 
Potty training.
 Some kids are ready to begin potty training at 25 months, but others aren’t—and if you try to push the issue, you’ll just end up losing to a very stubborn toddler. Watch for signs of readiness and reward any small successes, like sitting on the potty, if only for a few moments.
• 
Teething.
 Your child may be cutting his second molars. Also known as the 
2-year molars
, these pearly whites tend to erupt between 20 and 33 months. And since they're big, it can be a painful process. The good news is they're the last teeth to come in until around age 6, when kids can better deal with the discomfort, so soon, you'll be done with teething woes.
25-Month-Old Behavior
• 
Independence.
 Your 25-month-old likes to be in charge. Let your toddler make small decisions, like which shirt to wear today, but don’t be afraid to say no to the big things, like letting her climb the tallest slide in the park or the back of the couch. Two-year-olds need consistent, safe limits.
• 
Tantrums.
 Mega meltdowns may still be a problem. Be patient; eventually he’ll learn not to flip out so much.
• 
Defiance.
 At this age, there are lots of challenging behaviors that kind of depend on the child's personality. For example, some kids refuse to get into their car seat and others love to draw all over the walls when their parents are on the phone. This is where limits and firm consequences can help: "The car 
stops
 and we don’t go to the playground without the car seat buckled." "If you draw on the walls, you have to help Mommy clean them up." Give your child lots of positive attention when she's being good, and keep the permanent markers out of reach.
25-Month-Old Health
Health is always a top concern for parents, and this age is no different. Some common health questions parents of 25-month-olds have are:
• My 25-month-old has 
diarrhea
. What should I do?
• My 25-month-old is 
constipated
. What should I do?
• My 25-month-old is 
throwing up

• My 25-month old has a 
cough

• My 25-month-old has a 
fever
. What should I do?
25-Month-Old Sleep
As with every age, sleep routine is key for 25-month-olds. Stick to your usual, soothing bedtime rituals and be firm about the rules: One or two books per night, but not 10. Twenty-five-month-olds can be con artists and ask for a million books, songs, hugs—anything to delay bedtime. Try not to have negotiations every night; keep things consistent and fairly quick.
How Much Sleep Does a 25-Month-Old Need?
Most 2-year-olds need around 11 to 12 hours of nighttime sleep, plus a nap of about 1.5 to 3 hours, for a total of about 13 to 14 hours of sleep per day.
Every kid is different, but your child's schedule may look something like this:

Night waking
If your 25-month-old is waking at night, it can disrupt the whole family. To encourage a good night's sleep, you'll probably want to stick to certain nighttime rules. For example, if your child wakes at night and calls you, you come comfort her for just a few minutes before making an exit. Or if she comes into your room, you lead her back to her bed and tuck her right back in. It's probably okay to make exceptions when your 25-month-old is sick, has a nightmare or is teething. But otherwise, it’s best to stick to your guns.
25-Month-Old Food
At 25 months, focus on instilling good eating habits into your child. Pediatricians recommend having meals together as a family, making healthy food choices and not worrying too much about 
how much
 food your child is eating. In other words, don't pressure him to clean his plate.
How Much Should My 25-Month-Old Be Eating?
Two-year-olds should continue to eat three meals per day, plus two snacks. Offer her a variety of foods in all food groups—vegetables, fruits, grains, protein, and dairy—daily. Portion size isn't big at this age: Expect your kid to eat only ¼ to ½ as much as an adult.
Now that your child is 2 years old, he should be drinking 1% or skim milk, not whole milk. Try to offer low-fat dairy products, such as yogurt and cheese too. Doctors recommend kids ages one to three get 700 mg of calcium per day. Fat should account for less than 30 percent of your toddler's daily calories.
If your child is breastfeeding or gets calcium for other sources, she might not need to be drinking as much cow's milk as that. Nursing toddlers may only need to supplement with cow's milk if they’re not growing as expected on the growth chart; check with your child's pediatrician.
When to wean a toddler is a personal choice. If you're interested in weaning your 25-month-old, go slow to prevent plugged ducts and infection for you and to make the process easier on your child.

25-Month-Old Eating Problems
Picky eating is common at age 2, and while it's good to want your child to eat fruits and veggies, you never want to turn the dinner table into a battlefield. If you continue to offer a variety of nutritious food choices and let your 2-year-old choose from them, you're already setting her up for a healthy diet.
Toddlers tend to enjoy finger foods—like raw carrot sticks and celery, maybe even with a little dip—so try those if he's not into steamed or cooked veggies. Just keep a close eye on him to avoid a choking incident.
Activities for 25-Month-Old
25-month-olds love to walk and ride (gross motor skills), use their hands (fine motor skills), and have new fun, experiences.
What to do with a 25-month-old
Fun activities, games and toys for a 25-month-old are:
• 
Pop-up toys.
 Consider a plaything like a jack-in-the-box or an activity center with buttons and switches that make characters appear. These can teach cause and effect to a 25-month-old.
• 
Texture.
 Simple toys such as a bin of dry rice or beans, sand in a sandbox or Play-Doh let your child manipulate things with their hands. And they learn about size and quantity by filling up different-sized containers.
• 
Musical instruments.
 A toy piano, drum or xylophone will allow your kid to experiment with sound.
• 
Outings.
 Take your child to the park, pet store, aquarium or train station to experience new places and sights.
• 
Pushing and riding toys.
 A toy lawn mower, doll stroller, tricycle, or wagon are fun for an on-the-go 25-month-old.
25-Month-Old Baby Checklist/Tips
• It's normal for a 2-year-old to regress and want to be carried more often. Try to make trips fun by giving your child a "big kid" job, like holding a (light) bag of groceries while she walks. And consider having an umbrella stroller on hand for particularly stubborn moments.
• Don’t feel like playing with your kid? That's totally okay. Get him started on a bit of pretend play and then cook dinner or get other tasks done within his line of sight, while periodically checking on him.
• Moving to a toddler bed can be a tough transition. But if your child is consistently climbing out of the crib, it's time. Some people might recommend using a "crib tent" to discourage climbing but they're not considered safe. A bed with rails, a low-to-the-ground toddler bed, or even a mattress on the floor are much better options.
